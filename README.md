# Job Tracker
Simple full stack application to keep track of the jobs you found interesting by adding the base metadata such as:
- Company name
- Job Title
- Published at
- Ends At
- Applied status
- Href for job posting

## About the project

Originally I wanted to build this for my own needs so I could keep all interesting open positions in one place instead of bookmarks.
However, this ended up being a somewhat functional web app with Authentication and personal tables. 

All Tracked job posts are private and only seen by you.
